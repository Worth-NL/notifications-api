def upgrade():
    # quoth the docs:

    # SET NOT NULL may only be applied to a column provided none of the records in the table contain a NULL value
    # for the column. Ordinarily this is checked during the ALTER TABLE by scanning the entire table; however, if a
    # valid CHECK constraint is found which proves no NULL can exist, then the table scan is skipped.

    # so now we can add regular nullable constraints without worrying about a lengthy table scan.
    op.alter_column("services", "email_sender_local_part", nullable=False)

    # now get rid of the old constraint now that it's no longer needed. this is a weird process overall
    op.drop_constraint("ck_services_email_sender_local_part_not_null_check", "services")


def downgrade():
    op.alter_column("services", "email_sender_local_part", nullable=True)

    # notably this creates _with_ validating constraint otherwise we'll end up with inconsistency
